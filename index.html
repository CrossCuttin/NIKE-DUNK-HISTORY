    <h3>Nike dunk Timeline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1985</strong> - Be True To Your School” was Nike’s first attempt at marketing the Nike Dunk.
</li>
       <li><strong>1990s</strong> - Skaters gravitated to the Nike Dunks once they’d fallen out of favor elsewhere.</li>  
      <li><strong>1998</strong>  the brand revamped the Dunk High and reissued it in original and familiar colorways. The design nuances helped push the growing trend forward, but it wasn’t until 2001 when Sandy Bodecker was appointed the general manager of Nike SB that the model successfully infiltrated the industry.</li>  
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - Dunk Low Pro SB went into manufacturing.</li>  
      <li><strong>2006</strong> -Nike introduced the Dunk Mid Pro.</li>  
      <li><strong>Early 2010s</strong> - Nike SB Dunks kicking it across outer-city Nike outlets and general releases would be on sale at the mainstream retailers.</li>  
      <li><strong>2015</strong> - This was a real slump for the model. Nike SB Dunk ‘grails’ were sitting quietly amongst skateboarders’ and sneakerheads’ collections, no longer a part of the conversation.</li> 
      <li><strong>2019</strong> - Dunks really started making a mark in sneaker culture. Nike x Off-White Dunk Low dropped in three vivid and dynamically-blocked colorways; at the time Virgil Abloh’s Nike collaborations were the biggest topic in the world of sneakers. The SB Dunk was of course a natural contender for joining the Off-White™ rehashed roster.</li>  
      <li><strong>2020</strong> - Travis Scott x Nike SB Dunk Low Cactus Jack hit the market in February 2020, coming with removable paisley and plaid print overlays, shoe hysteria took hold of the model. It’s seen as one of the hardest cops of the year, with a painful amount of Ls taken worldwide. Travis Scott brought a new life to the Dunk, and more importantly, to a new generation</li>  
  
      <li><strong>Today</strong> - The Dunk is now an entirely universal silhouette, owned by no one (literally) and everyone (unfortunately not literally) at the same time. Long live the Dunk, may you persevere many years more.</li>  
    </ul>
    
    <i>"I very much believe that the Nike Dunk is one of the special shoes that cross-pollinates between an athletic icon but also a culturally relevant canvas over the years,"</i> <br><br>
    <i>-- Virgil Abloh</i>
